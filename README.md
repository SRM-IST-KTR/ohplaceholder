This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```

Editing the Project
	•	You can edit the main page by modifying pages/index.js. Changes will auto-update in the browser.
	•	API Routes: You can access API routes on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.
The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*, and files here are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
